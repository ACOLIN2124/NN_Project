# **CIFAR-10 Image Classification Using Advanced Neural Network Architectures**

---

## **Overview**

This project is a comprehensive exploration of neural network architectures for the CIFAR-10 image classification task. By leveraging both custom-designed networks and state-of-the-art pre-trained models, we evaluated and combined various approaches to create a high-performance classifier. The final model achieved a remarkable **test accuracy of 88.15%**, showcasing the synergy of innovative architecture selection and meticulous optimization.

The CIFAR-10 dataset, with its 60,000 32x32 images across 10 classes, is a benchmark for computer vision tasks. Its relatively small image size and complex class features make it an excellent challenge for testing advanced neural network designs.

This repository includes the implementation of multiple architectures, their evaluation, and the selection of a final improved model. It also reflects on the methodologies used, providing insights into deep learning practices and their applications in image classification.
